Examples on how to use Bootstrap.

I've created this repository as an addition to my blog on Bootstrap on http://sanderrossel.com. The specific blog can be found on http://sanderrossel.com/twitter-bootstrap-for-responsive-mobile-first-web-apps/.
It simply contains some examples of some Bootstrap features.
Simply run the BootstrapBlog.html in your browser to see the results. Open it in a text editor to see the actual HTML.
